# MCUnityShader
Converted shader from shadertoy from GLSL into HLSL with alterations to be playable when used in Unity via render textures (with argb float) or graphics blit to send output data images to other shaders as sources for input. Includes several readjustments to add additional button input compatibility and reformatted data transfer between shaders to avoid float errors.
